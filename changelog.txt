--- Version 0.1.3

- Conditional subtitle logic adjustement : if "Lang1:None and forced tag set" then disable subtitles
              but only if no Lang1 forced subtitle is found. Otherwise we activate this one.
	      
--- Version 0.1.2

- Adding an icon.png
- Fixing settings.xml CustomAudio, Sub and CondSub : allowempty=true to avoid multiple errors in the kodi log when not used.

--- Version 0.1.0

- Fixing conditional subtitles like "French:None" not working. Not detected and then subtitles were not disabled.
  (if sub_code is none) is the test to return -1 in default.py... But column 3 of None in langcodes.py is "non" as a string.
  So I just changed the test in line 268 accordingly, and all is fine now.
